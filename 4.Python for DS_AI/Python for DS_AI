'Python for Data science & AI

- Python is an "interpreted language". Compiled languages examine your entire program at compile time, and are able to warn you 
	about a whole class of errors prior to execution. In contrast, Python interprets your script line by line as it executes it. 
	Python will stop executing the entire program when it encounters an error, unless the error is expected and handled by the programmer.
	So Python will stop interpreting ASA it finds an error, but before it, it will produce the output.

- Python is an object-oriented language.
